## Dependencies

All the dependencies (external libraries) are defined in the single place - Gradle `buildSrc` folder. This approach allows to easily manage dependencies and use the same dependency version across all modules.

## TODO

- Navigate from exchanges screen to exchanges detail page.
- Use the search endpoint.
- Create bottom nav for the coins endpoint.
